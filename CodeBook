## Overview
This project processes data collected from the accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. The dataset contains records of various activities performed by subjects wearing the smartphone.

## Variables
- `subject`: Identifier of the subject (1-30).
- `activity`: The activity performed, such as walking or sitting.
- Remaining columns: The mean and standard deviation of various accelerometer and gyroscope readings, extracted and averaged per subject per activity.

## Transformations
1. Merged training and test datasets.
2. Extracted measurements of mean and standard deviation.
3. Applied descriptive activity names.
4. Used descriptive labels for variables.
5. Created a second, independent dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
